This plugin makes it easy to sell tickets and redeem them at the event location entrance for you in-person or virtual events. It integrates easely with your WooCommerce products.

Install the plugin and set your products to be a event ticket product. That's it.

The plugin will generate a secure ticket number and add them to the mail to your clients. It will also generate a PDF with the ticket information and QR code. The built-in ticket scanner allows you and your team to redeem the tickets by scanning the QR-code. You can also use an external keyboard scanner by using the text input field on the ticket scanner page.

You can even import your own ticket numbers, but it will generate them also on the fly. The freedom is in your hands.

The best is to try it out. So many options. Don't be shy, give it a try - you have nothing to loose :D


**Shop:** Sell event and party tickets with your normal products. The plugin will create the ticket number on the fly or use unused ticket numbers from your ticket number list for each sold item.

**Validation of ticket numbers:** You customer can validate a ticket number on your page. The ticket number generator gives you a flexible pattern to generate ticket numbers upfront. You can also **import your existing codes**.

**Validation of tickets:** You customer will get a link to a detail page and a PDF for each sold ticket.

**Build your own stolen ticket number database:** Support your customer and yourself to protect stolen ticket numbers to be sold or used to others. Mark reported ticket numbers as stolen and let others check the ticket numbers with the ticket number validator.

**How can you setup the ticket numbers?**
The ticket numbers will be generated by the plugin automatically, if you do not set up ticket numbers upfront.
You can enter your ticket numbers within the WP admin area in the ticket number section (a new menu point in the wordpress amdin area).
You can generate your own ticket numbers manually using the ticket number generator or import existing ticket numbers.
And you are also able to add your own ticket numbers by just entering them to the generated ticket numbers below the ticket number generator.
If needed you can assign the ticket (numbers) to a list which helps you to organize the tickets. The ticket list need to be assigned to a WooCommerce product.
Create one or more ticket lists to use the WooCommerce functionality.
Create bundle products - determine how many ticket numbers should be created with the sale of one product.

**How the ticket number works**
You define your look and feel for your ticket numbers. The generated ticket numbers will be unique. After you are satisfied with the generated ticket numbers, you can start the adding step.
The ticket adding step will check if the ticket number is unique on the server before adding it.
If the ticket number exists already on the server, it will not be added.

= The ticket number generator provides a lot of features: =
- Ticket number prefix - you can enter a fixed prefix to each ticket number
- Length of ticket number
- Only letters
- Uppercase, Lowercase or both
- Exclusion of letters that are easy to missread (i,l,o,q,p)
- Delimiter possible: [None, -, :, SPACE] - you decide after how many letters within the ticket number
- CVV code generation (only numbers)

Yes, this is a fork of the serial code validator plugin. We decided to make it an own plugin out of it. So to add more and more features that are not related to serial codes but to event tickets.

== GETTING STARTED ==

A Quick start is shown in this [video](https://vollstart.com/event-tickets-with-ticket-scanner/docs/#quickstart).
A good first start is to open the event ticket admin area and create a list first, if not already done or if you do not want to use the default ticket list.
Go to your WooCommerce product and activate the ticket sale option and set the list.
Check out all the possible options in the event ticket admin area to understand, how to tweak your usages of plugin.
Optional: Then add your ticket number by importing (add button at the ticket table) or assign the ticket list to your products.
Optional: If you need a validation form for your users, to check the ticket number, then please add the shortcode **[sasoEventTicketsValidator]** to a page.

= Steps to start =
- Go to the admin area and click on menu "Event Tickets".
- Click on button "Add" next to the heading "List".
- Go to your "ticket" product and set the option with in the product settings "Event Tickets"
*To scan the QR code of the sold tickets at the entrance:*
- Go to the admin area and click on menu "Event Tickets".
- Click on the button "Ticket Scanner" at the top area
- Scan tickets and redeem them

Try it out first, before you go Premium! ["Here you can find the premium plugin"](https://vollstart.com/event-tickets-with-ticket-scanner).

== Build your own Stolen products database ==
You can set the status of a ticket number to be marked as stolen. This way you can offer your customers a way to report a stolen product. Other buyers of used products can validate the ticket number on your website and will be notified with a "Product is stolen" warning.
This could increase sales and help reducing theft of your products.
The check behaviour will be like "inactive codes" but with the stolen message. You can change the stolen message within the options area of the serial code admin.

== Protection with CVV ==
You can set a code verification value (CVV) to protect your tickets. The validation check will ask the user to enter both for a valid check.
That way you increase the security of your ticket numbers and prevent stealing the numbers (If you are able hide the CVV on your packaging).
If you use a CVV on a ticket number, then the user will be asked to enter this CVV too during the validation. If the CVV on your ticket number is not set or empty it will be ignored and your customer is not asked for it.

== Woocommerce support for auto-generating tickets ==
**Supports version 6+**
**You can use this plugin to auto-generate tickets and codes for your woocommerce products**
* Create a code list
* Go to your WooCommerce product and edit the product which should receive a ticket
* Go to your WooCommerce product and edit the product which should receive a code - if needed
* Click on "Event Tickets" in the attribute area of your product
* Choose the "List" that will be used for this product

Everytime this product is sold, it will get a new generated ticket number/code or use an unused one within your list (This need to be activated within the option settings). The new code will be added to the code list you set on your WooCommerce product and to the product sale too.
If the sold product quantity in the order is more than 1, then a ticket number/code will be generated for each element. The code will be generated after the purchase. In case of a refund the code will be recovered and marked as unused, so that it can be reused.

*E.g.: Your customer bought 2 of the same product within one order, then 2 tickets will be generated and stored to the product item within this order.*

= WooCommerce Ticket Features =
* Automatically create and assign tickets for physical products and digital products
* Recover tickets assigned to refunded orders
* Option to reuse the recovered tickets with the latest orders
* Automatically deliver the tickets with the complete order email
* Automatically a ticket as PDF for download and add the download link to the complete order email.
* Automatically deliver the tickets and download URL with the optional PDF invoice "WooCommerce PDF Invoices"
* Download a flyer for your event or party

= WooCommerce Code Features =
* Automatically create and assign codes for physical products and digital products
* Recover code assigned to refunded orders
* Option to reuse the recovered codes with the latest orders
* Automatically deliver the codes with the complete order email
* Automatically deliver the codes with the optional PDF invoice "WooCommerce PDF Invoices"

**Please note:**
If you exceed your limit (*no limits for premium user*) of the amount of possible tickets/codes, then the ticket/code added to the sold product will be a text information: **"Please contact our support for the code"**.
This way your business is not harmed and your customer can contact you to get a code manually. The format of the code will be **12345-12345-12345-12345** if you do not set a generation format within the options.

== WooCommerce PDF Invoices support to display the ticket numbers on the PDFs ==
If you use ["WooCommerce PDF Invoices"](https://en-gb.wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce-pdf-invoices-packing-slips/), then the generated ticket numbers/codes are displayed on the generated PDFs too!
The supported PDF plugin is from Ewout Fernhout.

== WooCommer Ticket Sale ==
You can add a list to your product and sell tickets. The ticket will be added to the sale informations for you and your client.
The client will also have a link to check the ticket and mark the ticket as used, only if the order is set to completed. This will mark the ticket as redeemed.
You can check the entrance by letting your customer show the confirmation page and hit on the "redeem"-button.
Or you scan the QR code of the ticket with the ticket scanner (included). The ticket is also available as PDF for download to your customers.
[Checkout the video, how it works](https://vollstart.com/event-tickets-with-ticket-scanner/docs/#ticket)

== Frontend ==
We have different frontend elements. Just to sell tickets and scan them, you do not need to add any shortcodes to your pages.

= Frontend event tickets =
Your customer will receive a specific URL to the ticket detail page. You can control which information to display. additional they can download the ticket as a PDF.
The ticket will contain a QR code, that can be scanned by you or your team (no loggin to WordPress needed) and redeem the ticket.
[Watch the video for it](https://vollstart.com/event-tickets-with-ticket-scanner/docs/#quickstart)

= Frontent to validate the ticket number =
* Use the shortcode **[sasoEventTicketsValidator]**
* Create a page or use an existing one and add the shortcode to the page
* The shortcode will be replaced for your users by a form to enter the ticket number and a button to validate the ticket. This allows you to surround the form with your own heading and instruction.
* Each ticket number has a display version (e.g. XYZXYZ -> XYZ-XYZ), so it is easier for your user to read the ticket number.
* The check will remove the display delimiter "-", ":", " " for the check automatically.
* So your user can enter the ticket number with or without delimiters.

If you use CVV on a code and the user enter the ticket number that requires a cvv, then your user will be ask to enter the CVV.
The user could enter the CVV immediately with the code. Separate the value with a ":". E.g: XYZXYZ:1234.

It is possible to prefill the ticket number validation form with a ticket number.
Add the parameter "code" to your page URL to create a link that prefills the form.
*E.g https://vollstart.com/serial-codes/?code=123-456-789*

= Form options for expert =
You can use your own input, trigger and output HTML element.
Add the id parameter to your HTML elements and pass them to the shortcode as corresponding parameter.
You can add also your own JS function name that will be called before the ticket number is checked on the server and also if the result comes back.
